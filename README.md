Papiya Linux was a Linux From Scratch I made in 2016-17 when I was learning Linux. I made two major developments. One was a package manager based on [lfs-me](https://github.com/FSMaxB/lfs-me). It was a heavily modified version of lfs-me, and the second one was the install script. Unfortunately I posted most of the development of Google+, and with its death, all of that is gone. I didn't know how to use Git back then, so the package manager got lost when I changed computer. Only this install script survived.
